# ASIOASyncBattleshipGame
This project introduces a Battleship game implemented in C++ with asynchronous networking powered by ASIO. Developed in Visual Studio, it exemplifies the application of ASIO for networking in a game environment. In this setup, the server generates the map while the client focuses on guessing ship positions.
